# Overview

Sam Stemper and the Broad Center at the Yale School of Management have compiled a panel dataset of superintendents in more than nine thousand U.S. public school districts across 20 states. These files update and expand those used in Stemper (2022).

We plan to update these data once per year. When updating, we will maintain copies of all previous dataset editions on this site. 

We plan to add additional states as those data become available.  

We welcome contributions from users. If you would like to contribute superintendent data from other states or years, or if you notice an issue with the data or code, please contact us at broadcenter@yale.edu. 

## Use 

These data come from public records. You are welcome to use them. Please do so with the following citation: 

Stemper, Sam and The Broad Center. Superintendent Research Dataset (v1, 2025-09-05), 2025. 

## Contents

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `scripts/`: R scripts for importing, cleaning, and merging data.
- `output/`: Secondary figures, tables, and a memo.

## The superintendent research dataset

The final dataset is "data/processed/combined_superintendents.csv."  

The dataset contains eight variables. 
-id: this variable uniquely identifies each row of the data. The first two  digits are a state code and the remaining digits are within-state line numbers. 
-state: the state in which the district is located. 
-leaid: the local education agency identification number, suitable for matching to the Common Core of Data. 
-name_raw: name text as reported in the initial data source. 
-name_clean: name data in standardized format
-year: the fall of the academic year in which the superintendent data was recorded. 
-salary: superintendent salary in dollars. Not available for all states. 
-super_id: within-state superintendent individual identifier. This identifier is obtained by matching superintendents by name within states. 


## Code

To generate the dataset yourself from the raw data, open "us_superintendents_data.Rproj" and run "scripts/00_master.R." By default, this will use processed data files included in the package; to re-generate these from scratch, in line 1 of "scripts/00_master.R," set the toggle variable to 1. This has a normal run time of 20-30 minutes. 

The code proceeds as follows: 
1. Download and organize files from state-level sources.
2. Import data into R.
3. Link districts to their LEAIDs using state district IDs or district names using annual crosswalks from the Urban Institute's Common Core of Data (CCD) data repository.

## Data sources

All files are from state websites. Raw files extracted from these websites are stored in data/raw/. See "The Broad Center Data Extension Notes.xlsx" for details on data sourcing. 

## Benchmarking and known issues
See output/TBC_supt_memo_Sep_5_2025.pdf for descriptive statistics, comparisons to other published work on superintendents, and a list of known issues.
